# Object-Oriented Programming University Assignments

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) University Assignments repository. This repository contains a collection of assignments related to object-oriented programming concepts. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of OOP.

## Lab 1: Prime Numbers and Subsequences

In **Lab 1**, you will find C++ code consisting of two main functions, `teilaufgabe_a` and `teilaufgabe_b`, designed to address two different tasks related to numbers and prime numbers:

### Task A: Goldbach's Conjecture

- **Description**: Decompose a given even natural number, greater than 2, as the sum of two prime numbers.
- **Function**: `teilaufgabe_a()`

### Task B: Finding Subsequences with Common Digits

- **Description**: Find the longest contiguous subsequence in a vector of numbers, such that all consecutive elements have at least two different digits in common.
- **Function**: `teilaufgabe_b()`

## Lab 2: Working with Classes and Methods

In **Lab 2**, you will explore how to use classes and methods in C++. While there are three possible assignments, we have implemented Assignment 0
- **Description**: This exercise introduces the concepts of classes and methods in C++. It provides practical experience in working with lengths and their associated methods.
- **Functionality**: After successfully running the tests you have a sample demo.

## Lab 3: Working with 
Please feel free to explore each lab and assignment for in-depth learning and practice.
