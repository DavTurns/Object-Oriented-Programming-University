# Object-Oriented Programming University Assignments

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) University Assignments repository. This repository contains a collection of assignments related to object-oriented programming concepts. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of OOP.

**If you want to run any project, just click on compile_run.bat, make sure you have g++ installed**.

## Lab 1: Prime Numbers and Subsequences

In **Lab 1**, you will find C++ code consisting of two main functions, `teilaufgabe_a` and `teilaufgabe_b`, designed to address two different tasks related to numbers and prime numbers:

### Task A: Goldbach's Conjecture

- **Description**: Decompose a given even natural number, greater than 2, as the sum of two prime numbers.
- **Function**: `teilaufgabe_a()`

### Task B: Finding Subsequences with Common Digits

- **Description**: Find the longest contiguous subsequence in a vector of numbers, such that all consecutive elements have at least two different digits in common.
- **Function**: `teilaufgabe_b()`

## Lab 2: Working with Classes and Methods

In **Lab 2**, you will explore how to use classes and methods in C++. While there are three possible assignments, we have implemented Assignment 0
- **Description**: This exercise introduces the concepts of classes and methods in C++. It provides practical experience in working with lengths and their associated methods.
- **Functionality**: After successfully running the tests you have a sample demo.

## Lab 3: Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM)

This project involves the creation of a Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) representation for systems consisting of 7 to 12 elements, capturing their interdependencies.
The main goal was to learn how to work with pointer and with dynamically allocated memory.

## Lab 4: Fruit APP

- **Description**: This console application covers a short demonstration of the Model-View-Controller design pattern. You basically are able to perform CRUD operations on a virtual fruit storage.
- **Functionality**: After successfully running the tests you will have a sample demo.

## Lab 5 and Lab 6: Scooter APP

- **Description**: The Scooter APP is an extension to the previous Fruit APP with new features like persistence, polymorphism etc. And the user can perform CRUD operations on both Scooter shortage and on customerlist.
- **Functionality**: After successfully running the tests you will have a sample demo.

Please feel free to explore each lab and assignment for in-depth learning and practice.
